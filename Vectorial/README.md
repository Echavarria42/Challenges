**Root:** 

*Brute-force search:* Is a very general problem-solving technique and algorithmic paradigm that consists of systematically enumerating all possible candidates for the solution and checking whether each candidate satisfies the problem's statement. 

*Binary search algorithm:* Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half, again taking the middle element to compare to the target value, and repeating this until the target value is found.

*Newton–Raphson method:* Produces successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function. The most basic version starts with a single-variable function f defined for a real variable x, the function's derivative f ′, and an initial guess x0 for a root of f. If the function satisfies sufficient assumptions and the initial guess is close, then

is a better approximation of the root than x0.
