# Challenges
This repository will contain code snippets which are solutions to some challenges proposed by different platforms, I hope it will be helpful.

**Calculator:**

The file Calculator.py, as its name indicates it is a calculator that performs the basic mathematical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, having the possibility of introducing rationals. It also includes trigonometric operations such as sine and cosine, the power symbol and two irrational numbers Euler and Pi.
A lower right box that shows the last result, the possibility of deleting everything inside the box or only the last element inside the line.
It was made with Tkinter and the math library.

# Modular Algebra:

**Chinese remainder theorem:** (expressed in terms of congruences) is true over every principal ideal domain. It has been generalized to any commutative ring, with a formulation involving ideals.

**Euclidean division:**  is the process of dividing one integer (the dividend) by another (the divisor), in a way that produces a quotient and a remainder smaller than the divisor. The greatest common divisor (or highest common factor) of two integers a, b âˆˆ Z is the largest integer which divides them both.
