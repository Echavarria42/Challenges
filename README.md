# Challenges
This repository will contain code snippets which are solutions to some challenges proposed by different platforms, I hope it will be helpful.

1) Basic_01  => "https://platzi.com/comunidad/retos-de-programacion-en-cualquier-lenguaje-primer-nivel-salida-de-mensajes/"

You will choose what to do between: **Adding a pair of numbers, Subtracting pizzas, Adding 2 and Multiplying by another, Past and Future Age, Dividing the count, Calculating days, Converting Miles and Dividing.**

The file simply needs to be run and you will scroll through the different activities provided by the code.

2) Basic_02  => "https://platzi.com/comunidad/retos-de-programacion-para-cualquier-lenguaje-segundo-nivel-condicionales/"

These are functions that meet the specifications of the challenges posted in the link, functions include: **Major and minor number, In range, please, Changing ranges, I like turtles, How's the weather, Age allowed and Optional messages.**

The code is composed of functions which do not run automatically, if you want to test them you will have to call them from **main()**.

3) Basic_03  => "https://platzi.com/comunidad/retos-de-programacion-para-cualquier-lenguaje-tercer-nivel-strings/"

It is a consecutive questionnaire with instant answers, it is carried out by means of inputs that directly call the functions: **String length, initials, trim sentences, uppercase_LOWERCASE, short or long name and Pig Latin.**

Returning as a result what was proposed in the Platzi challenge.

4) Basic_04  => "https://platzi.com/comunidad/retos-de-programacion-en-cualquier-lenguaje-cuarto-nivel-matematicas/"

It is a consecutive quiz that performs basic mathematical and geometric operations such as: **Multiplication, Rounding, Square Root, Area of a circle, A number inside a number and area and perimeter of a prism.**

It will ask you the basics such as simple numbers to multiply, the radius or height of figures, doing it continuously and printing the results.

5) Basic_05  => "https://platzi.com/comunidad/retos-de-programacion-en-cualquier-lenguaje-quinto-nivel-ciclo-for/"

It is a consecutive questionnaire that asks a series of questions in order to run the functions that solve the challenges proposed by platzi, among these functions are: **Favorite course, acrostic, favorite animal, multiplication table, countdown, less than 15, add 4 numbers, number line."**

You just have to run the program and you will see all the results of these functions.

6) Basic_06  => "https://platzi.com/comunidad/retos-de-programacion-en-cualquier-lenguaje-sexto-nivel-ciclo-while-2/"

It is a consecutive questionnaire, which means that you only have to run the file to see the results, among the functions that are included in the file are: **Sum up to fifty, Beyond forty-two, Consecutive sums, Guest list, Guess the secret number.**

7) code__waris =>

It is a sequence of functions with solutions to problems proposed by the Code-Wars platform. These functions include: **Exact Divisors, Sum of digits, Word alrevez, Tribonacci, Permute, etc.**
