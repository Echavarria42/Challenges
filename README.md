# Modular Algebra:

**Chinese remainder theorem:** (expressed in terms of congruences) is true over every principal ideal domain. It has been generalized to any commutative ring, with a formulation involving ideals.

**Euclidean division:**  is the process of dividing one integer (the dividend) by another (the divisor), in a way that produces a quotient and a remainder smaller than the divisor. The greatest common divisor (or highest common factor) of two integers a, b âˆˆ Z is the largest integer which divides them both.
